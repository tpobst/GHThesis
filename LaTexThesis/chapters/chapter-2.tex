\chapter{Trend Analysis}\label{ch:TA}
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Trend analysis for Stream Survey has been done before and reported in \citep{robinson2008ph} and the Biotics effects report \citep{cai2012}
	\item A trend analysis of the data collected through the Stream Survey can be used to help determine the water quality of the streams
	\item The most important trend is the trend for pH
	\item {\bf Outline} The trend analysis will be conducted on Stream Survey data spanning the years 1993-2012 using the statistical program JMP 
	for determining outliers and the statistical program SPSS for the actual trend analysis.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Body}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A trend analysis will answer the continuing question concerning the overall health of the park which is, "How are the streams doing?".  
    More specifically "Is the pH trending towards a higher pH or a lower pH?"
    \subsubsection{Data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The data comes from years of analyzing water samples collected through the Stream Survey and is tabulated into a running data set.
        \item A single trend line could be made to encompass all 20 years worth of water quality data, but this would make discovering the cause of the trends
        more difficult.
        \item Assuming ecosystems try to achieve equilibrium the change observed over all time should be zero.
        \item So in order to easier learn from this trend analysis, it will be logically broken up into smaller sets of years.
        \item Different sets may have different positive or negative trends for which separate hypothesis have been or can be formulated and tested in this trend
        analysis.
        \item The separate data sets are between time and between elevation classes.  There were three different time sets created.  The first time set covers the years 1993 to 2002, these are the same years analyzed in \citep{robinson2008ph}.  The remaining years were broken up at 2008, which was the year that the Kingston and Bull run power plants installed scrubbers onto their stacks.  So with the six different elevation classes and the three different time sets there are eighteen different data sets that are analyzed in this paper.

    \subsubsection{Instruments}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item done usisng statistical programs.
        \item Outliler determination and trend hypothesis.
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item Plot pH on y-axis vs. all time.  This visually represents that the slope does not equal zero.  Check outliers in this plot.  If they can be explained then fix or delete them. 
        	\item Plot pH on y-axis vs. elevation.  Visually check for trend of decreasing pH as elevation increases.
        	\item Plot pH vs. month.  To check for seasonality.
        	\item Outliers found include Abrams, Anakeesta sites, and storm flow.  Abrams is consistently found as an out lier within GRSM water quality projects using stream survey data for statistical purposes.  Abrams is located in the Cades Cove area of the park and sits in natural limestone bedrock.  This limestone increases the ANC of the streams so much that many of  the measured Abrams pH values are high enough to be outliers and are thrown out of the data.
        	\item Water quality at sites 237 and 252 are heavily influenced by Anakeesta geology introduced into the streams through road cuts.
        	\item Storm flow is also usually seen as an out lier in past GRSM water quality projects.  Storms can bring high intensity rain fall which can very quickly raise the levels of nitrate and sulfate pollution in the streams.  The runoff can also carry any pollutants that have come to rest on vegetation or the ground.  The lowered pH of the streams caused by the storm flow can cause leeching of the surrounding mineral geology in affected areas. Healthy streams can rebound to normal pH values, unhealthy streams can have lowered ANC due to the leaching.  Measurements taken from storm flow can show uncharacteristically low pH values and high amounts of metals.  In this way storm flow is sometimes considered an out lier.  Much of the water quality data has been characterized as base flow and storm flow by Dr.Cai, but not all it.  Water quality data after 2010 has not been characterized.  Dismissing all of  storm flow as an out lier is complicated by this lack of information.  Either; storm flow and base flow would need to be determined for the 2011 and 2012 data,all of the 2011 and 2012 data could be left out, or 2011 and 2012 would need to be characterized as base flow or storm flow.  Throwing out the years 2011 and 2012 would leave the last time set with only two years of data.  The data was compared with and without storm flow observations.  It was determined to manually select out lier storm flow observations.  They can be removed on a case by case basis during the regression procedure.
	\item review output  for normality, heteroscedasticity, cook's D, DFBETAS, DFFITS.
	\item Find proposed out lier in original data
	\item Justify its removal, remove it and run the regression method again
	\item The outputs will change every time an observation is removed.
	\end{itemize}
	\input{FiguresnTables/stepwiseeq}
	\item The variable selected through this process were used to create fixed models to be used while discovering the Julian Date coefficient for each water quality variable in each data set.
	\item If the step-wise equation had at least one time variable in it(Julian date, $\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta)$) then the rest were added.  This is presented in \autoref{variables}.
	\item along with the step-wise regression method, another regression analysis was done using only time based variables.  These are the Julian Date, $\sin(\theta)$, and $\cos(\theta)$ time variables.  This method was used to find trends in the water quality variables that are related to time only.		
        \item IBM's SPSS was used to conduct this trend analysis.
        \item These options were chosen for regression and assumptions for this procedure include.(from notebook and textbook)
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In \citep{robinson2008ph} table 4 reports julian date coefficients for four water quality variables (pH, ANC, NO$_3$, SO$_4$) by each elevation band.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A similar layout was used in \autoref{tab:Step-wise julian date} and \autoref{tab:time vars}.
		\item This was done for continuity and ease of comparison.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The first trend analysis was completed using the step-wise method for choosing predictors and the results are presented in \autoref{tab:Step-wise julian date}
	\item The second trend analysis uses only time based variables as predictors and these results are presented in \autoref{tab:time vars}
	\item Both tables are modeled after table 4 in \citep{robinson2008ph}
	\item Each table is further divided into three different time sets: 1993-2002, 2003-2008, 2009-2012.
	\item Each of these time sets are further divided into six elevation bands
	\item Each of elevation band has the results of four trend lines, one for each of the studied water quality variables (pH, ANC, NO$_3$, SO$_4$).
	\item Each trend line is represented by its Julian date coefficient, the r$^2$ value for the trend line, and it's statistical significance.
	\item 2 of the 72 trend lines in \autoref{tab:Step-wise julian date} are insignificant.  In contrast only 20 of the trend lines in \autoref{tab:time vars} are significant.
	\item Insignificance is determined  by receiving a p-value greater than .05, the $\alpha$ of the trend line.  A p-value greater than .05 rejects the hypothesis that $\beta$ $\neq$ 0.  There is greater than a 5$\%$ chance that $\beta$=0.  There is to much chance of no trend line for the scientific community.
	\item Repeat trends from previous thesis
	\item Compare to \citep{robinson2008ph}, his trends are negative.
\end{itemize}
\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why were the trends insignificant?
	\item Why are the water quality trends trending the way they are at separate time sets ( discuss comparisons between sets in the ANOVA bonferoni section).
	\item How should the water quality variables have behaved based on known properties and \citep{robinson2008ph}.
	\item Very generally speaking these results are different than \citep{robinson2008ph} predicted.
	\item Water quality will continue to get better.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item because pollution is being regulated
	\end{itemize}
	\item there are still unknowns and prediction is still hard.
\end{itemize}
