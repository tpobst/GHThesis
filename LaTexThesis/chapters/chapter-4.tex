\chapter{Power Analysis} \label{ch:poweranslysis}
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Introduction}
The statistics preformed in \autoref{ch:TA} come with an inherent amount of error.  
This error in trend analysis is defined as type II or $\beta$ and can be seen in \autoref{tab:HypothesisTests}.
\input{FiguresnTables/HypothesisTests}
The trend analysis tests the hypothesis that a trend exists in the data.
The null hypothesis is that there is no trend or the coefficient is zero.
In simpler terms this means that the hypothesis for the trend analysis is that there is a positive julian date coefficient for each dataset and the null hypothesis is that there is not one.
$\beta$ describes the failure to reject a false null hypothesis or in the case of this paper a failure to detect a trend in the data when there really is one.
The opposite of $\beta$ is the probability that a trend will be detected when it exists and is called the power of the test.
A trend line with a power of 1.00 means that there is a 100$\%$ chance that the calculated slope is not zero.
The post hoc power of all 144 regression lines from \autoref{ch:TA} were calculated with the help of the statistical program G*power.  
An a priori power analysis can be used to help plan for the future by choosing a desired power and planning around it.
This analysis was also completed in G*power.


\subsection{Body}
The objectives of the power analysis are two fold.
It will calculate the power of each trend line and also give a more efficient sample size for desired powers.
The statistical program G*power requires four inputs total.  
Three of the these inputs are passed from the output of the trend analysis: number of observations (N), adjusted r$^2$ and number of predictors.
The fourth input is ES or effect size which is calculated by G*power before the analysis.
G*power is a free power analysis program written by four germen psychology professors.
It can compute both post hoc and a priori analysis for many different statistical tests.
A post hoc analysis was preformed for both julian date coefficient tables from \autoref{ch:TA},  \autoref{tab:SWposthoc} and \autoref{tab:TVposthoc}.
In contrast to the post hoc analysis the a priori analysis only needs to be calculated for each of the four dependent variables.
This output then has to be manipulated in excel in order to determine a number of sites per elevation bands.

\subsection{Procedures}
\subsubsection{Post hoc}

The most popular power analysis methods originate from Jacob Cohen who outlined his approach in " A Power Primer" \citep{cohen1992power}.
Cohen displayed ways to calculate the power for eight different tests the last of which is the F test for multiple and multiple partial correlation.
The different tests are represented by their differences in calculating ES.
Effect size is the only input that needs to be calculated before the analysis can be completed.
The equation for the ES of a regression model presented by Cohen is equal to the correlation coefficient divided by one minus the correlation coefficient.
This equation can be described as the ratio of explained to unexplained variation for the regression model.
For the post hoc analysis this equation will be used to calculate an specific ES for each model presented in \autoref{tab:SWposthoc} and \autoref{tab:TVposthoc} which correspond to the models in \autoref{ch:TA}.
 This calculation is calculated in G*power after inputing the correlation coefficient.
G*power uses ES along with the $\alpha$ used for the regression model, the number observations, and number of predictors in the model to output the power of the F test.
This number will be between 0 and 1.00 and will be the power acquired by the models using past data.

\subsubsection{A priori}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The a priori analysis can help survey planners to create a sampling survey that will produce trend lines with certain ES values and powers.
	\item There are two objectives to this analysis which are to create "power graphs", which are plots of power vs. sample size.  The other is to plan out an actual scenario for which samples can be added or subtracted to elevation bands for a desired power of .80 and an ES of .15.
	\item The power graphs are created in G*power using the "x-y plot for a range of values" button next to the "calculate" button.
	\item They-axis has the power values while the x-axis contains the number of observations or samples.  The power will increase with number of samples until it reaches 100.
	\item Four power graphs were created, one for each water quality variable.  If ES and power are set to .15 and .80 respectively for every presumed trend line then the only variable is number of predictors.  The number of predictors is set for each water quality variable (pH, ANC, NO$_3$,SO$_4$).  Taken from the earlier step-wise selection method (link to step-wise table).  Therefore only one "power graph" is needed for every trend line in each variable.
	\item ES and power can be chosen or kept constant based on reports by Cohen.
	\item Cohen's standardizations
	\item While the "power graphs" are useful in planning for the future of the stream survey, it can be shown that if ES and power are chosen, exact numbers of samples and sites can be added and subtracted from elevation bands.
	\input{FiguresnTables/aprioritable}%needs to be cleaned up
	\item The rest was done in excel
	\item This calculated number of observations can be divided by the number of samples collected in one year to get the number of years required to reach a power of .80.
	\item The analysis can be further conducted by calculating the number of samples per year to achieve a power of .80.  For this calculation all water quality variables were given the highest number of samples of 110 and 77 was used for the trends using only time variables.
		\input{FiguresnTables/sytaapeighty}%needs to be cleaned up
	\item \autoref{sytaapeighty} is needed to calculate number of samples needed per elevation band to achieve a power of .80.  This number of samples can then be further divided to get a number of sites needed to achieve a power of .80.  If a trend line with a power of .80 is desired after one year ,for all water quality variables to be satisfied, 110 samples need to be collected.  If four years are waited then only 28 samples need to be collected per year.
	\item  To create this final table the number of samples per elevation  band was subtracted from the number of samples to achieve a power of .80 which gives us the number of samples needed in addition to what is currently collected to receive a power of .80.  These results are organized into samples needed per elevation band to achieve a power of .80 and seperated by years depending of how many years of data go into the trend lines.
\end{itemize}



\section{Results}
\subsection{Post hoc}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A post hoc power analysis was conducted for each of the two methods of trend analysis.
	\item \autoref{tab:SWposthoc} and \autoref{tab:TVposthoc} record the results of the post hoc analysis on the trend lines with variables created through the step-wise method and the trend lines created using only time variables respectively.  Included in these tables are the number of samples and r$^2$ variables from the trend analysis and effect size and power from the post hoc analysis.
	\item \autoref{tab:SWposthoc} and \autoref{tab:TVposthoc} are broken into the four analyzed water quality variables (pH, ANC, NO$_3$,SO$_4$) and divided into the tree time sets (93-02, 03-08, 09-12), and then further divided into the six elevation classes.
	\item use results from previous draft
	\item any similar power analysis?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{A priori}
\subsubsection{Power graphs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The results of the a priori power analysis will be the most important for planning.
	\item The usual output is the "power graph" which plots power on the y-axis and total sample size on the x-axis.
	\item G*power outputs some very nice power graphs. The power graphs created from the a priori power analysis are presented in \autoref{fig:pHPowerGraph}, \autoref{fig:ANCnNPowerGraph}, \autoref{fig:SulfatePowerGraph}, and \autoref{fig:TVPowerGraph}.
	\item There were four power graphs created, three for the water quality variables and one for the time variables.  ANC and Nitrate both have the same number of predictors from the step-wise variable selection method and therefore create the same power graph. 
	\item each graph contains 3 lines representing 3 different ES choices: .15, .25, and .35.  These were chosen to mimic the choices of small, medium, and large effects standardized by Cohen in \citep{cohen1992power}.  Limitations of the G*power program left the best choices to be .15, .25, and .35.   A small effect of .02 was ignored because preliminary graph results showed it to be  not useful.	
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Planning with power analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Using the ability of the a priori power analysis to compute a number of samples needed for a certain power, a scenario was played out to see how many sites needed to be added or could be removed from an elevation band in the stream survey.
	\input{FiguresnTables/currentyrsto.80}%needs to be cleaned
	\item This scenario was followed through with both methods of trend lines.
	\item \autoref{currentyrsto.80} records the six elevation bands along with the site numbers that belong to them.  In the column labeled ,current n per year, the amount of samples collected per elevation band in the year 2012 was tabulated.  The values in the remaining columns were calculated by dividing the number of samples given in \autoref{APN} by the current samples per year column in \autoref{currentyrsto.80}.
	\item Looking at the table there are 26  samples collected in elevation band one in one year.  In order to compute a trend line that receives a power of .80 with pH as the dependent  samples would need to be collected for 3.77 years before the trend line is computed.   The larges is elevation class for a trend line in ANC or NO$_3$ which requires 9.08 years.
	\input{FiguresnTables/WQapsenario}%needs to be cleaned
	\input{FiguresnTables/TVapsenario}
	\item The left side of both \autoref{WQapsenario} and \autoref{TVapsenario} show how many more samples are required to get a trend line with a power of .80. 
	\item  In \autoref{WQapsenario} for elevation class 3, 48 more samples need to be collected if a trend line with a power of .80 is to be created after one year.  But if a trend line can wait to be created after two years, then there is a surplus of seven samples per year.  If four years can be waited there is a surplus of 35 samples which on the right side of the table translates into a surplus of 6 whole site locations per year.
	\item \autoref{TVapsenario} works the same way as \autoref{WQapsenario} but of course it uses different variables for the trend lines.
	\item results from previous draft
	\item any other papers like this?
\end{itemize}
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Post hoc}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The results presented in \autoref{tab:SWposthoc} and \autoref{tab:TVposthoc} show how the calculated power is highly affected by number of observations more than anything else.
	\item In \autoref{tab:SWposthoc}, even when the r$^2$ and ES values are relatively low if the N is greater than 100 then the power is excellent.
	\item \autoref{tab:TVposthoc} show the effect of the ES on power.  Other than these lines being insignificant, many of the ES values are small according to Cohen and when compared to \autoref{tab:SWposthoc}.  Low ES values and low observations create low powers.  Low ES values com from low r$^2$ values.  The low r$^2$ values can be blamed for the insignificance of the lines and the poor powers. 
	\item Some lines are just not well described by Julian Date,$\sin$($\theta$), and $\cos$($\theta$) only.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{A priori}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How can these results be used?
	\item How can these results be manipulated?	
	\item The results in \autoref{tab:WQapsenario} and \autoref{tab:TVapsenario} can help with both of the problems of The park wanting a cheaper survey and researchers wanting more high elevation sites.
	
	\item The table can be used to re-organize sites across bands.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the current SS scheme there is a surplus of sites in lower elevation bands and a deficit for sites in higher elevations.
		\item Looking at the right side of \autoref{tab:WQapsenario}, if trends are desired after four years of data with a power of .80 and an ES of .15, seven sites may be taken from elevation bands 2 and 3 and 5 would need to be added to elevation bands 4,5, and 6.
		\item After this re-arrangement two sites may be completely discontinued.
		\item This saves time, effort, and money, but it is a very specific scenario.		
	\end{itemize}
	\item The downside of an a priori power analysis is that once you pick all the variables that go into it, you can' t change them in the future
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Variables that can change include how you divide the sites into elevation bands
		\item Trend line creation (alpha, variable selection)
		\item Power analysis ( power, and ES)
	\end{itemize}
	\item If during the hypothetical situation in which four years are waited to do another trend analysis, a better model is found, then the survey would need to be re-evaluated to reflect the new model.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the model could require a different number of sites
	\end{itemize}
	\item Choices for power and ES could change
	\item planning with the a priori power analysis requires guessing the trends for the future.  % Thesis Conclusion?
	\item This guess will probably be based on the past , such as this one.
	\item This guess assumes that trends of the past will continue into the future
	\item The ANOVA/Bonferoni and the comparison between \citep{robinson2008ph} and the current trends shows that this is difficult.
	\item better understanding is needed
	\item At the end of the day the trends are positive!
\end{itemize}
