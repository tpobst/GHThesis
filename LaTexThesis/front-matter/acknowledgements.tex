\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank...
	Dr. Schwartz, Keil Neff, Matt, and Steve Moore.
	
	I would like to thank all the faculty and staff in the civil and environmental engineering program.  I was never lacking in offered help, from Larry and Ken to the Professors and the secretaries.
	
	I would like to thank Dr.Schwartz for giving me the opportunity for a graduate degree.  My responsibilities involved a lot of field work in the Great Smokey Mountains and I never bored of bragging about it.
	
	I would like to thank Matt Kulp and Steve Moore of wildlife and fisheries in the GRSM for funding me and any work done in the park.
	
	I would like to thank Mei Cai and Keil Neff who were post-docs for much of the time I was working on my degree.  Sometimes it was like having multiple bosses saying different things at once but most of time it was multiple mentors that could help me if one was unavailable.
	
	I would like to thank Chris Rollison and Keil Neff for teaching me everything I need to know to help on the GRSM projects.
	
	I would like to thank Jordan Hayes and Matt Aplin who were the two primary undergraduate helpers regarding GRSM work.
